# Look Use Case

The Login and Logout use cases are already implemented.

In a similar way, you are required to implement the Look use case. This use case must display the list of available products to the user.

## Use Case Analysis

The analysis of the use case includes four steps:

1. Description in text (Actor, Action, Steps)
2. Block Diagram
3. Class Diagram
4. Code Implementation

### 1. Description

- **Actor:** unauthenticated user, admin
- **Action:** look at the products
- **Steps**
  - retrieve the list of products from Data Module
  - display the products in Shelf Window

### 2. Block Diagram

### 3. Class Diagram

### 4. Code implementation

This is your homework :wink:
